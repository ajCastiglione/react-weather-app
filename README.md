# React Weather app

This web app displays the current weather in your area and a 5 day forecast. (or at least it will...)

## How to run the project
<ol>
<li>run the command npm install</li>
<li>then use the command npm start</li>
</ol>

Following those steps will give you the development build of the application. It can be compiled with npm run build.

## Status
Still rather new to React so im figuring out the best ways to use async requests and pass data between components so it isn't working atm.
